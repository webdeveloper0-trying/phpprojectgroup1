Intermittent fasting is a diet trend that many celebrities and influencers promote. But this diet has roots in prehistoric times when hunters and gatherers spent hours or days searching for food to survive. Both doctors and dieticians swear by intermittent fasting’s research-confirmed health benefits, including weight loss, mental sharpness, optimized hormones, lowered inflammation, and enhanced longevity.
</p>
<p>
The idea of going long hours or even days in between meals may seem impossible, but intermittent fasting is pretty flexible. There are many different ways to structure an eating and fasting pattern. However, intermittent fasting is not for everyone, especially those with certain health conditions.
</p>
<p>
Our team put DoFasting’s intermittent fasting app and weight loss supplements to the test to see if these products hold up to the hype. Read our full review below to determine if DoFasting is safe, effective, and suitable for your lifestyle.

How we evaluated DoFasting
</b>
<p>
DoFasting is one of many intermittent fasting weight loss programs, but how does it compare to other options?
</p>
<p>
After six weeks of following a 16:8 fasting schedule, our testers found they felt more focused, slept better, and had shed an average of three pounds per week. We identified several major criteria to evaluate DoFasting’s app and its supplements: safety, cost, customer experience, and ease of use. The effectiveness our team experienced while testing DoFasting is attributable to how the company generally excels in each of those areas.

Safety
7.5 / 10
</b>
<p>
DoFasting’s app and its optional supplements are based on credible research concerning weight loss. The app categorizes fasts based on experience level — beginner, intermediate, and expert — which is helpful if you’re unsure where to start.
</p>
<p>
Intermittent fasting has several health benefits, but it can result in some side effects, such as hunger, nausea, headaches, or fatigue. DoFasting’s supplements help alleviate some of these side effects by elevating energy levels and curbing hunger pangs.
</p>
<p>
Because intermittent fasting involves extended periods spent not eating, this particular diet is not ideal for everyone. Intermittent fasting may not be the safest option if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding, have diabetes, have a history of eating disorders, or have gastroesophageal reflux. We recommend talking to your doctor first before committing to intermittent fasting.

Cost
8.6 / 10

<p>
DoFasting does not list app subscription costs on its website: You must complete a questionnaire to find out the pricing options. As of now, DoFasting offers three autorenewal plans: 3-months at $2.96 per week, 6-months at $1.97 per week, and an annual plan that costs $1.27 per week. There is no free trial, but the price is lower compared to the competition.

Wrapped up in the cost is access to helpful features, including over 5,000 healthy recipes, a library of workouts, a fasting tracker, and the capability to log your food, weight, steps, and water.
</p>
<p>
If you purchase an app subscription, you gain access to discounted supplements and membership-only supplements.

Currently, DoFasting only sells two supplements through its website: DoFasting Box - Essential Fiber Complex that costs $69.99 for a one-month supply and Apple Cider Vinegar Gummies that cost $63.99 for a six-month supply. These supplement costs are in line with other options, but it’s difficult to compare because so many supplements exist on the market.

DoFasting offers a safe and effective way to lose weight with its app and supplements. You can customize your fasting method based on your lifestyle; track food, water, and steps; explore workouts tailored to your fitness level; and cook from an array of healthy meal options. The supplements help you burn fat, reduce hunger, and boost energy levels.

DoFasting also allows for a great deal of flexibility. But when it comes to weight loss, flexibility may not be what everyone needs. If you prefer having social support, structured meals or workouts, regular check-ins, or educational guidance, DoFasting is not recommended.
</p>

Ease of use
8.7 / 10
</b>
<p>
The prominent feature of the DoFasting app is the fasting tracker. You can choose a fasting method that fits your lifestyle or engage in challenge mode. And, if you so choose, the app will send daily reminders about your fast.

The other app features are really intuitive. Logging weight, steps, and water is a quick process. One of the best features is the workout library. The app guides you through every exercise with a video tutorial, and it keeps track of time.
</p>
<b>
The app’s only downside is the food-logging feature. If you eat a DoFasting recipe, you can easily log the food. However, the DoFasting app lacks a barcode scanner, which is standard for other weight loss apps. So if you eat a protein bar or store-bought hummus, you have to manually enter all of the nutritional information. The food-tracking feature could be further developed.

DoFasting’s supplements can seamlessly become part of your daily routine. Whether you mix a powder or chew on a gummy, the supplements are no-fuss and do not require special equipment or prepping.

What is intermittent fasting?
</b>
<p>
Intermittent fasting (IF) is a weight loss approach in which you cycle between periods of eating and fasting. Like any weight loss diet, IF works the same way: You consume less food energy than your body burns. Between meals — during a fast — the body uses up its sugar stores and burns fat.
</p>
<p>
IF severely limits calorie intake during certain days or time periods. Popular approaches to IF include:

5:2 fasting involves eating five days a week and fasting for two non-consecutive days.
Daily time-restricted fasting entails eating within a certain period of the day and fasting for the remaining hours. The most popular daily time-restricted fasting is the 16:8 method, in which you fast for 16 hours and eat during an eight-hour window.
OMAD fasting stands for One Meal A Day. It can be particularly difficult to get a day’s worth of nutrients in a single meal, so we would only recommend this to experienced fasters.
