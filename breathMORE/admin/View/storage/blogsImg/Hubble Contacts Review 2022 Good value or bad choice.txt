Hubble Contacts Review 2022: Good value or bad choice?

<p>Over 45 million people in the US wear contact lenses. Many of those people wear contacts designed to last one day before disposal. That usage pattern can get expensive, leading some folks to reuse their daily contacts — a dangerous practice for eye health.
</p>
<p>
Hubble is a subscription-based service that promises to make daily disposable contacts easy and affordable and promptly deliver them to your doorstep. Hubble’s subscription offering starts at just $39/month, with the opportunity to buy a 15-day trial for just $1.
</p>
<p>
Does Hubble live up to their promise? Our testers dove deep into Hubble’s products and services to give you all the information you could need to decide for yourself.

How we evaluated Hubble

Cost
Rating: 9.5/10
</b>
<p>
Hubble offers some of the lowest prices on daily contacts anywhere. Their subscription model is convenient and easy to calculate, with a yearly supply of contacts costing just $468. That includes shipping, but not your state’s taxes. You’d be hard-pressed to find better prices for the service they provide.

Quality

Rating: 6.5/10

<p>
Unfortunately, Hubble keeps their costs low by relying on outdated material for their contact lenses. Some customers report discomfort with regular use, and extended wearing can lead to severe complications. Still, there are plenty of users who report no issues, even with years of consistent use. However, from a health and safety perspective, we can’t rate them any higher than this for quality.

Selection

Rating: 6/10
</b>
<p>
Hubble offers one type of lens in one size. You can adjust along a typical spectrum of power to ensure they can accurately correct your vision, but this only matters if your eye matches the contacts’ base curve and diameter, which are set in stone. That means most people with astigmatism can’t use their service, nor can those who require multifocal lenses. Fortunately, Hubble has a sister site — ContactsCart — where these customers can find admirable savings.

Customer care

Rating: 9.0/10

<p>
Hubble makes up for a lot of their selection and quality shortcomings in the customer care department. They have one of the most straightforward websites to navigate that our testers have come across, allowing them to move through the ordering process with incredible speed.
</p>
<p>
Their representatives via chat, email, and phone were responsive and intelligent, and our wait times on the phone rarely exceeded three minutes. We also find it very convenient that they verify your prescription on your behalf, calling your optometrist directly. This service saves you the hassle of digging out your prescription, photographing it, and uploading it on your own time.

What is Hubble?

Hubble Contacts

<p>
Benjamin Cogan and Jesse Horwitz founded Hubble in New York in 2016. They are self-described “long-term users of contact lenses” who wanted to make single-use contact lenses — AKA dailies — simpler and cheaper to purchase. Thanks to an aggressive social media campaign and a superbly designed website, the company quickly garnered social media attention and investment capital.

Rather than reselling contacts made by established brands (such as Acuvue or SofLens), Hubble outsources the manufacturing process to St. Shine Optical, an FDA-approved facility located in Taiwan.
</p>
<p>
Hubble has a sister site as well — ContactsCart — where you can buy your favorite brands of contact lenses at a discounted price (20% off your first order) and with free shipping.

Hubble also offers glasses in designer-quality frames that are durable and reasonably priced. They can’t quite compete with the likes of Zenni and some other providers in terms of cost, but if they have a style you like, they might be able to save you some money compared with a larger chain.

How Hubble subscriptions work
</b>
<p>
Hubble’s business model utilizes a subscription that delivers a one-month supply of daily disposable contact lenses (60 lenses total) to your doorstep every 28 days.

The service costs $39/month, plus applicable sales tax and $3 for shipping and handling. This is a remarkably attractive offer for daily contact lens wearers, who often pay between $25 and $45 for one box of 30 lenses (and use two boxes per month). If that describes you, then Hubble could easily save you between $100 and $600 each year.

Conversely, if you wear monthly or bi-weekly contact lenses, then Hubble’s subscription may be more than what you currently pay. Here’s a quick breakdown of costs compared with a competitor:
