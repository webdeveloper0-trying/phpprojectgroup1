Candid Review: Is Candid teeth straightening legit?

Teeth straightening treatments are notoriously slow – and not cheap. A typical treatment like braces or Invisalign usually costs $4,000-$7,000.
</p>
<p>
Candid aims to deliver a less daunting and more affordable alternative for people with mild to moderate teeth positioning problems, such as crowding, spacing, or protrusion. The company offers the same custom-made aligners offered by traditional services, accompanied by regular remote monitoring of your treatment.
</p>
<p>
What’s the difference, then, between Candid and the aligners you get from the dentist? We thoroughly tested Candid’s teeth straightening service and offer you the pros and cons to help you decide whether it’s a good choice for you.

How we evaluated Candid
</b>
<p>
To give you the most thorough and accurate information about Candid, we focused on five fundamental criteria: how professional they are, both in your consultation and throughout the treatment process; the quality of treatment and results; and your total cost.
</p>
<b>
Professional expertise
9.5 / 10
</b>
<p>
Candid stands out from other online orthodontic companies because they only use orthodontists for diagnostic services and treatment design, compared to other online orthodontic companies whose plans are often overseen by dentists with no orthodontic experience. It takes 2-3 years to fully train as an orthodontist, so they are the most qualified to treat bite and alignment issues.

Candid orthodontists have an average of 20 years of experience in the field. Plus, as of 2022, you’ll need to go into a Candid-approved orthodontist’s office to get started, so you’ll have professional support at every step.

Consultation experience

Previously, Candid offered 3D scans in their Candid Studio locations as an alternative way to get a consult for those living in major cities. One of Candid’s advantages was that you could use an at-home putty impression kit no matter where you were. Although the company’s website claims a 3D scan isn’t better than impressions, 3D scans are considered the gold standard for most orthodontist offices. Some Candid customers are asked to redo their at-home impressions for better accuracy. As of late January 2022, however, these at-home starter kits are no longer available, and every customer must see an orthodontist in-person for their consultation.
</p>
<p>
One downfall of their shift from mail-order starter kits to in-office consultations is that if you don’t live near an office, rather than missing out on a potential perk, you won’t be able to get started with Candid at all. However, with over 180 partnered Candid Studios nationwide and a rapidly growing network, if you can’t find a Candid Studio now, there’s a good chance that you’ll be able to find a nearby location soon. Many of their studios are in both big and small cities, from New York to Birmingham to Tampa.

Treatment quality
8.8 / 10
</b>
<p>
Candid doesn’t promise the fastest treatment results and doesn’t offer other abbreviated services like nighttime-only aligners. Still, the average treatment time ranges from 6-10 months – far less than most braces or Invisalign treatments. We see these policies as indicative of Candid’s medically sound principles and expertise. Fastest doesn’t always mean best, particularly when faster and nighttime-only treatments can put patients at greater risk for complications.
</p>
<p>
Candid also provides a ScanBox device that you hook up to your smartphone to take a full scan of your teeth for regular treatment monitoring. Your scans are reviewed by the orthodontist that designed your Candid treatment plan. When it’s time for a new scan or aligner switch, you receive a notification through your Candid app – and these check-ins are every 14 days, which is more frequent than other at-home aligner companies or traditional orthodontist schedules.
</p>

Commitment to results
8.8 / 10
</b>
<p>
Candid’s more frequent check-ins and use of ScanBox technology mean there’s more opportunity to pick up on problems throughout the treatment process than with some other at-home aligner companies. Still, like many companies in the at-home orthodontics area, Candid doesn’t provide a money-back guarantee on its product.

Should your results not measure up to what’s shown in your 3D treatment plan, Candid will consider a “refinements process,” which is additional aligners to make final corrections for no extra cost. To be eligible for consideration, you must request refinements within 30 days of finishing your treatment and have followed correct procedures while undergoing treatment.

If you’ve fulfilled these requirements, Candid asks you to do another set of updated scans. From there, Candid decides if you’re eligible for refinements and, if so, creates a new treatment plan with an additional set of refinement aligners.

Cost and payment options
7.4 / 10
</b>
<p>
Before the company’s big switch, an at-home treatment cost $1,895 with an additional $19.99 for the starter kit. This is a competitive price with other at-home aligner treatments – and well-priced for the quality of care you’d receive. Now, the price is dictated by the orthodontist, not Candid.

While they report that customers spend an average of about $3,500 on their treatment, there’s no way to predict what it’ll cost you. That new average is almost double what it used to be and is only a few hundred dollars less expensive than traditional methods like Invisalign. The highest quoted price our testers could find was $7,000, again placing Candid in the price range of more traditional tooth aligners.
</p>
<p>
Candid’s insurance eligibility and financing options are on par with other well-established at-home aligner companies and in-network with a few major insurance providers. Their teen treatment isn’t currently in-network with any insurance companies, but they can file a partial reimbursement on your behalf.

What is Candid?
</b>
<p>
Candid was founded in 2017 by a team of tech entrepreneurs and orthodontists who wanted to create a new way to provide teeth alignment treatment. They aimed to give the same orthodontic results with a simpler, more affordable process without sacrificing medical standards or quality.

In January 2022, Candid launched a total renovation of their services. They had been known for their high-quality, at-home aligners at a relatively low cost but have discontinued their at-home starter kit and in-office studio scans. This means that you can no longer pursue Candid’s treatment fully from home.
</p>
<p>
Instead, Candid now works more like a traditional Invisalign treatment: go into a Candid-partnered orthodontist’s office to get a consultation and scans, then Candid ships your aligners and ScanBox to the orthodontist instead of your home. With this new method, you can get even better clinical oversight, limiting the chances of revisions or concerns even more than before, but it comes at the expense of convenience and an increased price.
</p>

Who is Candid for?
</b>
<p>
Candid might be an ideal choice for people who have good oral health but are looking to correct mild to moderate alignment issues. It’s critical to commit to the full 22 hours a day you’ll need to wear your aligners, as well as following through on the check-ins and aligner transitions orchestrated by your orthodontist.
</p>
<p>
Candid’s standard treatment is designed for adults, but the company also offers a separate teen version of its alignment treatment with additional steps and restrictions.
</p>
<b>
Who isn’t an ideal customer for Candid?
</b>
<p>
Like other at-home aligners, Candid aligners can only correct mild to moderate problems. You’ll probably need intervention beyond what aligners can give you if you have a more severe issue like:
</p>
<ul>
<li>An underbite</li>
<li>An overbite</li>
<li>A crossbite</li>
<li>A teeth crowding problem</li>
</ul>
<p>
Likewise, if your teeth and gums aren’t in great health, you might be ineligible or be asked to seek dental care for existing issues that could make moving your teeth unsafe.
</p>
<pre>
In order to ensure your oral health and safety, Candid starts the process with scans from a licensed orthodontist in person. Upon review, Candid can determine whether you’re a suitable candidate for treatment and whether you’ll need to take care of any oral health issues before treatment. If you aren’t accepted as a candidate for treatment, Candid offers a full refund.

Candid’s treatment options
The focal point of Candid is their invisible aligner. This aligner can fix mild to moderate concerns about the position or alignment of your teeth, including:

Gaps
Crowded sections
Protruding teeth
Typically, treatment lasts no longer than 10 months, but expect to spend about six months adjusting your smile.

Candid aligner
For the most part, Candid’s clear aligners work just like traditional aligners like Invisalign. Candid’s aligners are made from clear, BPA-free thermoplastic.

A complete treatment kit includes:

8-12 aligners, numbered in the order you should use them
A pack of whitening foam
A ScanBox device that you hook up to your smartphone to create a full scan of your teeth for regular monitoring
A treatment plan designed for you with a local orthodontist
Remote monitoring of your progress through regular at-home teeth scans with the ScanBox is included in the treatment cost. Your orthodontist will tell you when it’s time to move from one aligner to the next based on information from these scans. Each aligner is worn for 2-3 weeks before moving on.

The total cost of Candid’s aligner treatment varies depending on your orthodontist. Our research found it ranges from $3,500 to $7,000, putting it in the same ballpark as more traditional aligner methods like Invisalign. The purely at-home Candid option previously cost $1,895, a significant difference.

Custom retainers ($99)
While the final aligner in your treatment kit doubles as your first retainer, Candid recommends replacing these retainers every six months due to wear and tear. They only provide one retainer at the outset; any other retainers past that 6-month mark need to be purchased separately.
