Veganism was once viewed as a fringe subculture of radical animal rights advocates, but its popularity has grown exponentially in the past several decades. Today, people choose vegan diets for many reasons, including a love of animals, health benefits, environmental concerns, and religious reasons.
</p>
<p>
There are now an estimated 79 million vegans worldwide, and their dining options have also expanded with more vegan restaurants and food products available than ever before. While veganism isn’t inherently healthy — Oreos and Swedish Fish are both vegan — it makes it more likely that you’re providing your body with the right nutrients. Eating a healthy and balanced plant-based diet has many health benefits and may play a role in preventing certain diseases. This guide details 45 distinct health benefits of adopting a vegan diet.

<b>
Nutrition
</b>
<p>
Vegan diets provide healthy nutrition in plant-based forms, including grains, nuts, legumes, fruits, and vegetables. Eating a well-balanced vegan diet can benefit your health in the following ways.
</p>
<p>
Saturated fats. Plant-based diets are low in saturated fats, which contribute to cardiovascular problems and many other health issues. By eating a vegan diet, you can reduce your cholesterol intake and risk of heart disease.
Carbohydrates. Vegan diets also supply healthy portions of carbohydrates, which give your body the energy necessary to thrive.
Fiber. Fiber promotes many aspects of digestive health, from cleaning your gastrointestinal tract to stimulating bile acids and lowering serum cholesterol. Dietary fiber provides prebiotics that feed good bacteria, contributing to a healthy gut.
Magnesium. Magnesium is an essential nutrient that contributes to many bodily processes, such as regulating blood sugar, blood pressure, and muscle and nerve function. It also helps your body produce bones, protein, and DNA. Plant-based diets rich in nuts, seeds, and dark leafy greens have ample opportunities for your magnesium intake.

Potassium. Potassium is an essential mineral that contributes to the body’s fluid balance of water and pH. It also stimulates the kidneys so that it can eliminate toxins and reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Vegan diets typically provide more potassium than omnivorous diets.
Folate. Folate is an essential water-based B vitamin responsible for cell generation and repair, as well as the metabolization of amino acids. Folate is found in vegetables (especially Brussels sprouts, asparagus, and dark leafy greens), beans, nuts, peas, and fruits, all of which are easy to center in a vegan diet.
Antioxidants. Antioxidants are substances that may prevent cellular damage. Fruits and vegetables are rich sources of antioxidants, which lower the risks of several diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and cataracts.
Vitamin C. One specific antioxidant, vitamin C, is derived from citrus fruits and many other fruits and vegetables. Vitamin C contributes to immunity, helps the body process iron absorption, and assists in collagen production.
Phytochemicals. Phytochemicals come in the form of many dark leafy green vegetables. They work with antioxidants in the body to promote protective enzyme production and prevent and heal the body from cancers.
Vitamin E. Vitamin E is a fat-soluble nutrient that is plentiful in diets rich in grains, nuts, and dark leafy greens. This potent vitamin contributes to many aspects of health, including benefiting the heart, eyes, skin, and brain. Eating a vitamin E-rich diet may even help prevent Alzheimer’s disease.
Protein. Protein is a crucial component of all diets, but it’s a common misconception that vegans struggle to get enough protein. Plant-based diets combine incomplete proteins — in the forms of beans, nuts, lentils, quinoa, and soy products — to make whole proteins that provide adequate amino acids for vegans.

Disease prevention
</b>
<p>
As plant-based diets have popularized in Western societies, researchers have studied the health benefits of veganism and found many short- to moderate-term benefits of vegan diets over omnivorous or carnivore diets, including the following.
</p>
<p>
Cardiovascular health. Many studies have demonstrated the benefits of a vegan diet on our heart health. Diets centered on whole grains, nuts, fruits, and vegetables show lower intermediate risks and disease factors. Plant-based diets also reduce risks for type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.
Lowering cholesterol. Studies have shown that plant-based diets reduce blood lipids (in the form of LDL cholesterol) and lower cardiovascular disease risks. These diets (including vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian, and Mediterranean dietary patterns) are particularly beneficial for those attempting to manage dyslipidemia.
Blood pressure management. Plant-based diets help to reduce blood pressure in studies of hypertensive adults. Typical therapies for hypertension include additional exercise and sticking to a healthy diet. In one study, researchers showed a marked improvement in 107 of 192 hypertensive patients when placed on a vegan diet.
Preventing type 2 diabetes. Recent research shows evidence that plant-based diets effectively reduce key diabetes-related macrovascular and microvascular complications and treat type 2 diabetes.
Protecting prostate health. Three new studies suggest that a plant-based diet may help protect against prostate cancer and erectile dysfunction. Results of these studies showed that those following a plant-based diet were less likely to get prostate cancer, and in those who did, the tumors were less developed than in patients with omnivorous diets.
Preventing colon cancer. Diets rich in fiber, prebiotics, and probiotics maintain a healthy gut and colon. Studies have shown that vegetarian and vegan diets are linked to fewer colon cancer diagnoses, meaning they may help to prevent the disease.
Reducing the risk of breast cancer. In a study looking at almost 4,000 women, researchers determined that consumption of healthy, plant-based diets reduced the risk of breast cancer in participants.

Protecting eye health. In a 2021 study on age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), the leading cause of blindness, researchers found that those who consume a vegan diet are 32% less likely to develop ARMD. In much the same way, plant-based diets are also protective against cataracts due to their high antioxidant levels.
Reducing arthritis pain. A recent 2022 study showed that eating a vegan diet can reduce arthritis pain. Participants in the study also experienced weight loss and improved cholesterol levels when they switched to a plant-based diet.
Protecting bone health. Although no studies show that plant-based diets have detrimental effects on bone health, theoretical findings suggest that vegan diets may reduce the risk of osteoporosis.

Physical benefits
</b>
<p>
In addition to improving your health and preventing disease, eating a plant-based diet has many physical benefits, including:
</p>
<p>
Reducing premenstrual symptoms. Many women who switch to plant-based diets experience less cramping and PMS symptoms. Studies have shown that following a low-fat, vegetarian diet diminishes dysmenorrhea and premenstrual symptoms, potentially due to dietary influences on estrogen activity.
Preventing migraines. Switching to a vegan diet may help reduce your symptoms if you suffer from chronic migraines. Case studies have shown that following a plant-based diet high in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds may help minimize your migraines and lessen their frequency.
Diminished allergies. Individuals with chronic congestion and seasonal allergies may find relief in switching to a vegan diet. There are several reasons for this, including that over two-thirds of the global population has some kind of lactose intolerance which improves when you stop eating milk and dairy products.
Reduced BMI. Among all dietary styles, vegans often have the lowest BMI. This giant study of 22,434 men and 38,469 women showed that the mean BMI was lowest in vegans, rising incrementally in lacto-ovo vegetarians, pescatarians, semi-vegetarians, and non-vegetarians.
</p>
<p>
Losing weight. Over 41% of Americans are currently obese. Studies show that switching to a vegan diet is effective in preventing obesity and treating it by helping you lose weight in a healthy manner and keep it off.
Improving energy levels. Dragging energy levels can make it challenging to get to the gym. By reducing your consumption of added sugars, dairy products, meats, and fats within a vegan diet, you can experience boosted energy levels.
Longevity. Vegans live longer than non-vegans. In a six-year study, researchers studying diet and mortality determined that vegetarians (including vegans, lacto-ovo vegetarians, pescatarians, and semi-vegetarians) had a 12% lower mortality rate than non-vegetarians.

Improving breath and body odor. Going vegan can make you smell more attractive. When eliminating sulfur-rich meat and dairy products from your diet, you’ll notice a remarkable improvement in your body and breath odors.
Healthier hair and nails. Reliance on the nutrients you attain from a healthy and varied vegan diet support stronger and healthier hair and fingernails. Your hair may also become thicker after eliminating meat and dairy.
