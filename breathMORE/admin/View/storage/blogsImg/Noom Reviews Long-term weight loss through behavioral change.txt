According to the CDC, more than 40 percent of American adults are obese. As the Mayo Clinic points out, obesity significantly impacts health and increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis, and many other dangerous health conditions.

Many people who have tried to lose weight know it isn’t easy to accomplish. Several factors— including psychological roadblocks like stress, anxiety, and boredom—influence eating behaviors.

Cost

<p>
Noom’s pricing is based on a subscription model, and the longer you subscribe to Noom, the lower your per month cost is. During the sign-up process, Noom recommends a monthly subscription that’s based on how long it will take you to reach your ideal weight. As a comparison, a monthly autorenewal subscription costs $66.35, and a year-long autorenewal plan costs about $17 per month. Noom usually offers free or incredibly discounted trials so you can experience its weight loss plan before committing.
</p>
<p>
Compared to similar services, Noom is reasonably priced, especially for its comprehensive offerings, including a personal coach, access to a community, daily lessons, and its incredibly user-friendly app. You could create a piecemeal experience similar to Noom for much less money by joining weight-loss communities on social media or using free food and exercise tracking apps like MyFitnessPal. But Noom’s focus on educating and empowering you with its well-designed tools is unbeatable.

<p>
The best weight loss plan is one you can stick to, and Noom has made it incredibly easy to commit to it. Because the Noom program is accessible via the app, you have access to everything you need in the palm of your hand. You can adjust the app settings so you receive reminders about logging food. You can pair the Noom app to a fitness tracker or your smart scale so your movement, calories, and weight are automatically logged each day.
</p>
<p>
Noom’s daily lessons are also on its app, and they are chunked into bite-size, manageable chapters so you can read or listen to them whenever you have time. In testing the app, we also found that the daily lessons were rather enjoyable—a moment to learn and accomplish something during the day.

Personalization for individual needs

<p>
Because everyone is different, there are no one-size-fits-all weight loss programs. Noom recognizes this and offers an array of options so you can ensure your weight loss program works for you. To begin, Noom suggests a subscription based on your weight loss goals. Noom doesn’t expect you to use the app indefinitely. Rather, Noom empowers you with knowledge and tools so you form and sustain healthy habits long after the subscription ends. Subscriptions range from one month to an entire year, so it really depends on what you need.
</p>
<p>
Noom doesn’t prescribe any workouts or meals; you choose what to eat and how to exercise. However, if you’re looking for something a bit more prescriptive, Noom sells meal and workout guides for an additional cost.
</p>
<p>
Noom also customizes the support you receive. You can choose to work with a Noom guide, or if you’re looking for more accountability, you can work with a coach. And for added support and camaraderie, Noom also has a community, if this is something you’re interested in.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the above major personalization options, there are also little things along the way, such as app settings, that Noom has taken into account so your weight loss program works for your lifestyle and preferences

Customer care

<p>
Noom delivers some of the most motivating and considerate care. After signing up, your Noom Guide contacts you to answer any questions. Whether you’re messaging a Noom Guide or a Noom Coach, they are positive, sincere, and supportive. You immediately feel like someone is cheering you on throughout your weight loss journey.

The company’s support team is also incredibly helpful and timely with their responses. Representatives responded to our questions via email within minutes. They were exceptionally friendly and thoughtful in their communication.
</p>
<p>
Overall, Noom is supportive with most of its communications—aside from the payment process. This was the only interaction when Noom felt pushy and manipulative instead of caring and supportive. But once you purchase a plan, Noom never adopts that approach again.
